## Spawn Manager

Use the Spawn Manager button on the main menu to enable or disable what spawns in the game.

Only the host needs the mod for multiplayer. The host determines which enemies/valuables are enabled.\
If you are not the host, this mod is ignored.

### Features
* Enemies
* Valuables
* Including custom assets!

### Known Issues
* After starting a game, you can no longer find and re-enable valuables in the list. Restart the game to change valuables.
* Level never starts when you disable all valuables in the game.
* Spawn Manager button is visible before the menu animation is complete.
