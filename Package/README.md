## Spawn Manager

Use the Spawn Manager button on the main menu to enable or disable what spawns in the game.\

Enemies can be disabled on a per-level basis, an example on how this works:
- Enemy enabled in global config and disabled on Level - Manor: enemy will not spawn in the Manor level
- Enemy disabled in global config and enabled on Level - Manor: enemy will not spawn in any level

Only the host needs the mod for multiplayer. The host determines which enemies/valuables are enabled.\
If you are not the host, this mod is ignored.
